This is a git plugin that will track the time you spend working on a project.

This plugin will keep track of the time spent in the editor. Will try and workout how much time is being spent on the current activity, and it will track this data by project and the specific job within that project.

The times that are collected from the editor are stored in a simple comma separated timesheet. This should make it easy to use and import into different tools. It will stored by default in the $(HOME)/timesheet.tmk. This is obviously configurable.

This plugin will also allow for the timesheet data to be added as a git note. This will allow for the time to be read by software that can read the contents of these notes.

The git notes are only added to the current branch for the current job, hopefully this will reduce the problems that git-notes have with push/branching and merging.

The plugin will find other instances of vim with the plugin loaded, and the first one to load will become the master server. All other instances will send there updates to the server. If the current server disappears then the first to notice will become the new server. This will reduce the chance of two instances losing time updates from other servers.
